special thanks to this guy who put a lot of work into his repository and youtube video series where he explains anything you need to know to rebuild this CPU build  
check out his works:

### [ThomasBuchinger](https://gist.github.com/ThomasBuchinger)
he adapted Ben's partlist for the European vendor [Reichelt](https://www.reichelt.de/) since some parts are hard to find in Europe
you can find it [here](https://gist.github.com/ThomasBuchinger/92f848d017fa94d7c7886f224a20c198)

## Software
the schematics you can find in this repo are all created using KiCad. Ben Eater did create those already, but since my parts are slightly different than his,   
I redesigned the circuits myself following his example. I can only recommend to try it yourself since one can learn a lot and maybe eventually even solder the CPU on a PCB board using the in KiCad generated gerber files.   
And the 3D animated models are beautiful!!!
